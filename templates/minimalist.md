# Minimalist Template (PARA Method)

Simple 5-folder PARA structure for those who prefer simplicity.

## Folder Structure

```
Target-Directory/
├── 0-Inbox/                # New files land here first
├── 1-Projects/             # Active work with deadlines
├── 2-Areas/                # Ongoing responsibilities
├── 3-Resources/            # Reference materials
└── 4-Archive/              # Completed/inactive items
```

## How It Works

| # | Folder | Question to Ask | Examples |
|---|--------|-----------------|----------|
| 0 | Inbox | Is this new/unsorted? | Downloads, attachments |
| 1 | Projects | Does this have a deadline? | Client work, assignments |
| 2 | Areas | Is this an ongoing responsibility? | Taxes, health records |
| 3 | Resources | Might I reference this later? | Articles, templates |
| 4 | Archive | Is this done/inactive? | Old projects, past years |

## Daily Review (5 min)

Process each file in `0-Inbox/`:

```
Is this actionable?        → 1-Projects
Ongoing responsibility?    → 2-Areas
Reference material?        → 3-Resources
Completed/inactive?        → 4-Archive
None of the above?         → Delete
```

## Detection by Extension

```yaml
categories:
  2-Areas:
    - .pdf (invoices, statements)
  3-Resources:
    - .jpg, .png, .gif (images)
    - .mp4, .mov (videos)
    - .dmg, .exe, .pkg (software)
```

## Naming Convention

Keep it simple: `description.ext`

No dates or codes required for minimalist workflow.

## Best For

- People who want PARA without complexity
- Those new to file organization
- Shared computers
- Quick cleanup sessions

## Upgrade Path

When ready for more organization, consider:
- Adding subfolders to 2-Areas (Finance/, Health/, Legal/)
- Adding subfolders to 3-Resources (Media/, Tools/, Learning/)
- Using date prefixes in filenames
